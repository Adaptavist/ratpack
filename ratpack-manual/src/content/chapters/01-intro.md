# Introduction

Ratpack is a set of Java libraries that facilitate fast, efficient, evolvable and well tested HTTP applications.

It is built on the highly performant and efficient Netty event-driven networking engine.

Ratpack focuses on allowing HTTP applications to be efficient, modular, adaptive to new requirements and technologies, and well-tested over time.

## How to read the documentation

The canonical reference documentation for Ratpack is the [Javadoc](api/).
This manual acts as a starting point for different aspects of Ratpack and as a mechanism to pull together larger ideas and patterns.
The manual frequently introduces topics at a high level and links through to the Javadoc for detailed API information.
Much work goes in to making the Javadoc (hopefully) useful.

## Project Status

Ratpack is a new project, but stands on the shoulders of well established technologies and is built by developers with substantial experience in web application frameworks and tooling. 
It is currently pre 1.0 but under very active development.

No API compatibility guarantees are provided before the 1.0 release, from which point on the API will be strictly semantically versioned.

While it is new, it has received many man hours of development time.
