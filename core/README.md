# Ratpack

## A Micro Web Framework for Groovy

Ratpack is inspired by the excellent [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) framework for Ruby, and aims to make Groovy web development more classy.

This project is the Ratpack API on which the framework is built. If you want to get started with a Ratpack project, you should check out the [Ratpack Project Template](http://github.com/tlberglund/ratpack-template) or the [Ratpack Gradle Plugin](http://github.com/tlberglund/ratpack-plugin).
