# What is Ratpack?

Ratpack is a simple, capable, toolkit for creating high performance web applications.

Ratpack is built on Java and the Netty event-driven networking engine. 
The API is optimized for Groovy and Java 8, though Java 7 can also be used.

Optional Google Guice integration provides a foundation for scaling your application in size in a managed way.

Optional Gradle build time support makes building and testing applications a breeze.
