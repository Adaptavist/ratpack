# Setup

Ratpack is purely a runtime.
There is no installable package.
To build Ratpack applications, you can use any JVM build tool.
The Ratpack project provides specific support for [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) through plugins, but any could be used.

Ratpack is published as a set of library JARs.
The `ratpack-core` library is the only strictly required library.
Others such as `ratpack-groovy`, `ratpack-guice`, `ratpack-jackson`, `ratpack-test` etc. are optional.

With Ratpack on the classpath, you can use the API described in the next chapter to launch the application.
