This is the future home of the source of www.ratpack-framework.com.

If you'd like to help build a Ratpack app as this site, then please see https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/issues/4.

## Current status

### Running this application

To run the application in development mode use `gradle run` as normal for a Ratpack application.

Currently the following pages are available:

* `/` redirects to `/index.html`.
* `/logo.html` - prototypes for the Ratpack logo.
* `/chapter1` - a markdown rendered template.
